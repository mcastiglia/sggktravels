                He keeps to the coast, fording each course, <br />
                crossing at Holy Head and coming ashore <br />
                in the wilds of the Wirral, whose wayward people <br />
                both God and good men have quite given up on. <br />
                And he constantly enquires of those he encounters <br />
                if they know, or not, in this neck of the woods, <br />
                of a great green man or a Green Chapel. <br />
                No, they say, never. Never in their lives. <br />
                They know of neither a chap nor a chapel <br />
                so strange. <br />
                He trails through bleak terrain. <br />
                His mood and manner change <br />
                at every twist and turn <br />
                towards that chosen church. <br />

            Once again, this is just a passing remark to the reader of how long Sir Gawain has traveled so far
            throughout Wales.
            Here, he passes over River Dee and therefore moves into England.
            He starts to get confused why no one in all of his travels has known who the Green Knight is or where he
            resides.
            He continues to travel around England until his next stop.
